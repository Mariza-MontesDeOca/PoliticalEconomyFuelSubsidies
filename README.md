**"The Political Economy of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Removal: Evidence from Bolivia and Mexico"**

## Overview

We study the impact of fossil fuel subsidy removal on presidential popularity using a combination of a stylized theoretical model and empirical difference-in-differences analysis.

The project examines two major subsidy removal events in **Mexico** and **Bolivia** during the early 2010s, leveraging both **macro-level** approval data and **micro-level** survey data.

## Key Findings

- **Negative Impact on Approval**: Removing fossil fuel subsidies has a significant **negative effect on presidential approval**.
- **Theoretical Insights**: A **probabilistic voting model** predicts that:
  - Popularity losses are concentrated among **high-income groups** when subsidies are **regressive**.
  - **Low trust in government** reduces public support for subsidy reform across **all income groups**.
- **Micro Evidence**: We confirm these theoretical predictions using **household-level data** from Mexico's reform episode.

## Methodology

- **Empirical Strategy**: Difference-in-differences design with macro approval ratings across time and countries.
- **Theoretical Framework**: Stylized probabilistic voting model accounting for heterogeneous preferences and political trust.
- **Case Studies**:
  - Mexico: 2012â€“2014 gasoline subsidy phase-out.
  - Bolivia: 2010 diesel and gasoline subsidy removal attempt.
